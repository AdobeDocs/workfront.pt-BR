## Considerações ao configurar regras de negócios

* É possível configurar regras que indicam quando os registros podem ser editados ou excluídos.

  Por exemplo, você pode criar condições para exigir que determinados campos tenham um valor. Se o valor estiver ausente nesses campos, os usuários não poderão editar ou excluir esse registro.
* Não é possível adicionar regras de negócios a tipos de registros globais nos espaços de trabalho principal ou secundário.
* Não é possível configurar regras para quando os registros são criados. Qualquer pessoa com permissões de Gerenciar para o tipo de registro pode criar registros.
* É possível criar uma condição para a regra de negócios que faça referência a todos os tipos de campo, exceto para o seguinte:
  * Campos de fórmula
  * Campos de pesquisa
  * Campos de referência

## Configurar regras de negócios

1. Ir para um tipo de registro.
1. Clique no menu **Mais** ![Mais menu](assets/more-menu.png) à direita do nome do tipo de registro e clique em **Regras de negócio**.

   A página Business rules é aberta.
1. Clique em **Nova regra de negócio**.
1. Na caixa Nova regra de negócios, adicione um nome para a regra de negócios no primeiro campo disponível. Este campo é obrigatório
1. (Opcional) Adicione uma descrição para definir a regra de negócios.

***********FROM CLAUDE - BELOW - MUST EDIT*******************


### What business rules actually do

Business rules attach a condition to a **status change**. Instead of enforcing complete data the moment someone creates a record (which would slow everyone down), the rule only kicks in at one specific, deliberate moment: when a status is about to change to a status you've configured.

A rule looks like this in plain language:

> "Before a record can move to **Ready for Execution**, the field **Brand** must have a value."

If the field is empty, the status change is blocked and the person gets a clear message telling them what to fix. Once they fill it in and try again, the change goes through.

A few important things this is *not*:

* **It doesn't block record creation.** People can still create a new record instantly and fill it in over time, exactly like today.
* **It doesn't auto-fill anything or auto-change statuses.** A person always has to make the status change themselves.
* **It doesn't retroactively flag old records.** Records that are already sitting in the target status aren't affected — the check only runs the next time someone tries to move a record *into* that status.



### Before you start

A couple of things need to be true before you can configure rules:

1. **The feature has to be turned on for your organization.** This is done on Adobe's side (via a feature flag), not something you enable yourself. If you don't see the business rules section described below, check with your Adobe contact to confirm it's been enabled for your tenant.
2. **You need admin or workspace-configurator permissions.** Regular planners can't create or edit rules — only people managing the workspace setup can.

### Step 1: Open the business rules configuration area

Business rules live alongside your other admin setup — you won't need to hunt for a separate "Planning" panel. From your workflow setup area:

1. Go to the main **workflow setup / admin configuration** area for your workspace.
2. Look for the **business rules** section for the record type you want to configure (for example, "Materials" or "Campaigns").


### Step 2: Choose the record type

Rules are configured per record type, so pick the one you want to add a rule to. For example, if you want to make sure every Materials record has key fields filled in before execution, select **Materials**.



### Step 3: Create a new rule

For each rule, you'll specify three things:

| What you set | Example |
|---|---|
| **Record type** | Materials |
| **Target status** | Ready for Execution |
| **Required field** | Brand |

In other words: "When a Materials record's status is changed to **Ready for Execution**, the field **Brand** must have a value."

You can add more than one rule for the same status. For example, you might require Brand, Therapeutic Area, Indication, and Estimated Launch Date all to be filled in before a record can move to "Ready for Execution" — each is its own rule, and all of them are checked together.

**What fields can you require?**

* Connected record fields (e.g., a linked Brand or Indication record) — the rule passes as soon as at least one record is linked.
* Standard text fields (single-line or paragraph) — the rule passes once there's any value.
* Date fields — the rule passes once a date is set.

**What you can't use yet:** formula fields and lookup fields aren't supported as rule targets in this release, since they're calculated in the background rather than filled in directly by a person.

### Step 4: Write the message people will see

When you create a rule, you'll also provide the message that shows up if someone tries to make the change without the field filled in. Keep it specific and actionable — something like:

> "Brand is required."

You don't need to worry about formatting a whole error banner — the system handles combining messages if multiple rules are violated at once (see below).

### Step 5: Save the rule

Once saved, the rule takes effect **immediately** for everyone in the workspace — no need to log out, refresh, or wait for a deployment. The very next time anyone tries to move a record into that status, the rule is checked.

### What your team will actually experience

Here's what changes for the people using Planning day to day, once a rule is live.

#### If a required field is empty

1. A planner opens a record and changes the status to the gated status (say, "Ready for Execution").
2. The system checks all rules tied to that status.
3. If a required field is empty, the change is **rejected** — the status reverts back to what it was.
4. A toast message appears, naming exactly which field(s) are missing:
   > *"Status change blocked: 'Brand' and 'Estimated Launch Date' must be populated before moving to 'Ready for Execution.'"*
5. The planner fills in the missing field(s) and tries the status change again.
6. This time, the rule passes, and the status updates normally.

#### If everything is already filled in

Nothing changes. The status updates instantly, with no extra steps or popups. Business rules are invisible until they're actually needed.

#### If several fields are missing at once

All the violated rules are checked together, and the message lists every missing field in one go — planners don't have to fix one field, try again, get told about the next one, and repeat.

### Step 6: Edit or remove a rule later

Rules aren't set in stone. To make changes:

1. Go back to the business rules configuration area for the record type.
2. Find the rule you want to change.
3. Edit the required field, target status, or message — or delete the rule entirely.
4. Save. The change applies immediately to future status changes.

Keep in mind: editing or deleting a rule **only affects transitions going forward.** Records that already made it into the target status before the change aren't reevaluated.
3## A few things worth knowing

* **This is separate from locking records after a status change.** Business rules (as described here) only check field completeness *before* a status change goes through. A different, related feature governs whether a record becomes fully locked from edits/deletion once it reaches a certain status — that's not what's covered here.
* **Bulk status changes** (changing status on many records at once) aren't fully defined yet for how they interact with business rules — if your team relies heavily on bulk actions, check with your Adobe contact on current behavior.
* **If a rule can't be evaluated** due to a system error, the transition is blocked rather than silently allowed through — you'll never end up with an incomplete record slipping past a rule because of a backend hiccup.
* **Turning the feature off** doesn't delete your configured rules — they're just paused. Turning it back on restores them exactly as they were, no reconfiguration needed.

### Quick reference: setting up your first rule

1. Confirm the feature is enabled for your tenant.
2. Go to workflow setup → business rules for your record type.
3. Choose the record type (e.g., Materials).
4. Create a rule: target status + required field.
5. Write a clear, specific error message.
6. Save — it's live immediately.
7. Repeat for each field you want to require.
8. Test it yourself: try changing a record's status with the field empty, confirm you see the expected message, fill in the field, and confirm the status change now goes through.

That's it — from here on, anyone converting a record forward will get a clear nudge if something's missing, instead of a downstream project quietly showing up incomplete.
